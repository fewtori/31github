ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm @fewtori! ðŸ‘€ I have a keen interest in cars, programming, and exploring new places. ðŸŒ± Currently, I am immersed in the world of programming and eagerly learning the ropes. ðŸ“« You can reach me at fewtori@gmail.com.

Embarking on the 31 Day Challenge presented by GrowthHungry, my goal is to delve into the realm of programming. Over the next 31 days, I aim to attain a basic proficiency in the Java language. This challenge not only provides an opportunity for learning but also serves as a means to enhance time management and self-discipline. For the past two months, the desire to start learning was present, but each day was marked by procrastination. Thanks to GrowthHungry for presenting this challenge and providing the push needed to take the first steps in this exciting journey!
